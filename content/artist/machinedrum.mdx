I'm pretty certain GTA is where I first heard Machinedrum, and the sound grew on me over the years, now consider them essentials.

Just saved the [extended Room(s) album](https://open.spotify.com/album/196HRr4E4Jlu4U43bL3Kbj?si=mTmf3jNCRfKJcPxHFfghPQ), will give it a listen sometime soon.

This playlist is not short of mature bass work, good stuff.

The one track reminded me of this Bassnectar tune. Which I don't know the name of btw, I just remember it by album artwork, and playlist, and approximate location in that playlistðŸ˜…spacial & visual creature, haha
